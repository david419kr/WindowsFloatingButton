A simple configurable floating button for windows, to run a exe file.  
Made for self-usage, via Autohotkey V2.0.  

You can download compiled executable at [release](https://github.com/david419kr/WindowsFloatingButton/releases/latest).  

The usage is pretty self-explanatory.  
1. Set any .exe file  
2. Run
3. (Optional) You can run multiple floating buttons by making copies as you want. Please refer to the example GIF.  

First, here is a brief usage example gif.

It can be moved and resized by dragging blank area or edge.  
The left button is "run" button, and the right one is settings.  

At settings, you can select an exe to launch, adjust opacity, and change background color.
